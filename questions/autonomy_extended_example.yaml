# Extended Autonomy Questions Example
# Shows how you can add multiple questions to the autonomy dimension

autonomy_questions:
  # Original autonomy question
  autonomy:
    title: "ðŸŽ¯ Autonomy Level: How much decision-making power does the AI have?"
    help_text: "Consider who makes the final decisions in your workflow"
    required: true
    options:
      tool:
        title: "Tool"
        description: "AI provides recommendations only - humans always decide"
      assistant:
        title: "Assistant"
        description: "AI executes tasks with human approval - humans approve each action"
      agent:
        title: "Agent"
        description: "AI acts independently within defined boundaries - humans monitor"
      autonomous:
        title: "Autonomous"
        description: "AI manages entire workflows without oversight - humans only audit periodically"
    reasoning_prompt: "Why did you choose this level? (Optional)"

  # NEW: Additional autonomy question about scope
  autonomy_scope:
    title: "ðŸŽ¯ Decision Scope: What range of decisions can the AI make?"
    help_text: "Consider the breadth of decisions the AI is authorized to make"
    required: true
    options:
      limited:
        title: "Limited Scope"
        description: "AI can only make very specific, predefined decisions"
      moderate:
        title: "Moderate Scope"
        description: "AI can make decisions within well-defined domains"
      broad:
        title: "Broad Scope"
        description: "AI can make decisions across multiple business areas"
      unlimited:
        title: "Unlimited Scope"
        description: "AI has no restrictions on decision-making domains"
    reasoning_prompt: "What factors determine the AI's decision scope? (Optional)"

  # NEW: Additional autonomy question about frequency
  autonomy_frequency:
    title: "ðŸŽ¯ Decision Frequency: How often does the AI make autonomous decisions?"
    help_text: "Consider how frequently the AI acts without human intervention"
    required: true
    options:
      rarely:
        title: "Rarely"
        description: "AI makes autonomous decisions less than once per day"
      occasionally:
        title: "Occasionally"
        description: "AI makes autonomous decisions a few times per day"
      frequently:
        title: "Frequently"
        description: "AI makes autonomous decisions multiple times per hour"
      continuously:
        title: "Continuously"
        description: "AI is constantly making autonomous decisions"
    reasoning_prompt: "What drives the frequency of AI decisions? (Optional)"
