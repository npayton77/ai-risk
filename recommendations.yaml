# AI Risk Assessment Recommendations
# Configurable recommendations based on risk levels and specific conditions

# Base recommendations by risk level
by_risk_level:
  low:
    - "Implement standard review processes for AI outputs"
    - "Establish clear escalation paths for edge cases"
    - "Maintain documentation of AI decisions and human overrides"
  
  medium:
    - "Implement regular audits of AI decision quality"
    - "Set up confidence thresholds for autonomous actions"
    - "Establish fallback procedures for AI failures"
    - "Monitor for model drift and performance degradation"
  
  high:
    - "Implement comprehensive real-time monitoring"
    - "Set up automatic circuit breakers for anomalous behavior"
    - "Develop rapid rollback capabilities"
    - "Assign dedicated AI oversight personnel"
    - "Conduct regular stress testing"
  
  critical:
    - "Implement sandboxed testing environments"
    - "Require formal verification of AI behavior"
    - "Install emergency kill switches"
    - "Conduct extensive simulation testing before deployment"
    - "Consider if this risk level is acceptable for your organization"

# Conditional recommendations based on specific combinations
conditional:
  - condition:
      autonomy: ["agent", "autonomous"]
      oversight: ["minimal"]
    recommendation: "HIGH PRIORITY: Increase human oversight given high autonomy level"
  
  - condition:
      impact: ["external"]
      oversight: ["exception", "minimal"]
    recommendation: "CRITICAL: External impact requires more frequent human review"
  
  - condition:
      autonomy: ["autonomous"]
    recommendation: "Consider implementing AI explainability tools"
  
  - condition:
      data_sensitivity: ["regulated"]
      autonomy: ["agent", "autonomous"]
    recommendation: "COMPLIANCE ALERT: Regulated data with high autonomy requires legal review and audit trails"
  
  - condition:
      data_sensitivity: ["confidential", "regulated"]
      oversight: ["minimal", "exception"]
    recommendation: "SECURITY PRIORITY: Sensitive data requires enhanced monitoring and access controls"
